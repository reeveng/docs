Once upon a time, there was a person who carried a heavy burden deep within themselves. It was a burden called depression. At first, it was just a whisper, a subtle feeling of sadness that lingered in their heart. But as time went on, it grew louder, gradually permeating every corner of their existence.

Depression became more than just an emotion; it was a constant companion that shadowed their every step. It cast a heavy weight upon their shoulders, making even the simplest tasks feel like monumental challenges. The person's once vibrant thoughts and joyful moments began to fade, replaced by a persistent emptiness that seemed impossible to fill.

As days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, depression dug its claws deeper into their psyche. It distorted their thinking, convincing them that happiness was an illusion and that they were destined to remain trapped in this dark, endless tunnel. The person's energy waned, leaving them weary and drained, as if their very essence was being consumed by the relentless grip of depression.

At times, they tried to push it away, fighting against the suffocating presence that had become so ingrained within them. But no matter how hard they fought, depression remained steadfast, clinging to their identity like an uninvited guest who refused to leave.

With each passing day, depression whispered insidious lies, chipping away at their self-esteem and hope. It created a distorted mirror through which they saw themselves, distorting their perception until they questioned their worth and doubted their ability to ever escape its grasp.

Yet, deep within their core, a flicker of resilience remained. A constant thought: "Is this what defines me"? Or will I reign victorious?
