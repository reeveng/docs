I don't see how I could get rid of this. When it will go away. How it can go away.

How I can make it go away.

A permanent feeling, something or someone that's haunting you.

It stalks you everywhere you go. There is no hiding. No moment of rest.

Maybe, I'm too demanding, and just have to let it go. Not be busy with it every so often. In order for it to leave my mind, me... .

Maybe I shouldn't let it rest. Or maybe I really should let it rest. Otherwise it might be me that rests.
