My older bro mentioned DPDR to me the other day, and I got all curious and started digging into it. Turns out, DPDR is this kinda weird mental thing that messes with how you feel about yourself and the world. Like, you might feel like you're sort of floating through life, watching yourself from the outside.

Imagine cruising through your day, and bam! You get this feeling like everything's a bit off, like you're in a movie you're not really starring in. And those feelings you usually have, the ones that make you feel real? They can suddenly get all hazy, leaving you feeling like you're stuck in a fog of nothingness.

But hey, isn't it just, like, totally normal to sometimes feel like you're in some dreamland that's straight out of your imagination, right?
