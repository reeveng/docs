If I were to die tomorrow, I would have said the things I wanted to say, to those who I wanted to say it to.

Written and send the words hard to speak or convey meaningfully otherwise.

I have no further worries, nor valuable words, wisdoms, ... left to spread.

If I ever were to go, at least now, I am ready for it.
