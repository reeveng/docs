It's been though lately, at least internally. Marathon left, marathon right, look at me not being able to sleep a night.

Although things have been looking up lately, something has shifted within me, not sure exactly what.

Every so often, I lookup as many details as humanly possible about relatives, today the hunt was scarce, didn't really discover anything new. I hoped I would, but nawthing.

Everyone I know around my age is feeling depressed, I feel like it might not be a me thing after all, maybe we all just realise how utterly fucked we are. Then again, might just be me projecting.

ugh, nite nite
