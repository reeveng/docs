Lately I feel way more stressed. As if constantly I see everything burning in front of my eyes. The only times I feel somewhat ok, is during solitary walks, a breath of fresh air, a period of nothing asking/requiring attention.

My solitary walks became a temporary escape from the harsh reality. The quiet moments, surrounded by nature's fleeting beauty, provided a brief respite from the suffocating weight of despair. But no matter how far I walked, the burning world remained inescapable.

In the depths of my own turmoil, I sought answers. I delved into the origins of this catastrophe, desperate to understand how it had come to be.

I want to escape this reality so badly, yet I have too many people that depend on me. If I escape reality, those around me will crumble, what I build will burn and nothing will be left standing.

I have to sit this one through üôÅ, don't give up idiot, this isn't about you.
