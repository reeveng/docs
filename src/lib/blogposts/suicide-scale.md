<!-- ## 13/06/2023 Suicide scale -->

Yesterday evening, I saw this funny representation of how far into suicide you are.

![what scale of suicide are you on?](https://github.com/reeveng/Me-VS-Depression/blob/main/images/reddit-suicide-scale.jpg)

I feel like most people I know are about a 2 on the scale. Wonder what I'd be if I could be objective about it. What's your rating on the scale?
