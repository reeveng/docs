<!-- ## 19/08/2023 Exhaustion of negativity -->

There are countless ways for individuals to interact with one another, to communicate and share feelings, whether it's through spoken words, non-verbal signals, or even the intangible vibes they emit. Yet, puzzlingly, there exists a subset of individuals who persistently choose to engage in toxic behavior ([This little comic consisting of 13 pictures, I found on reddit showcases perfectly the consequences](https://me-vs-depression.vercel.app/slideviewer?images=multipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-01.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-02.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-03.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-04.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-05.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-06.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-07.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-08.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-09.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-10.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-11.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-12.webp%2Cmultipage-reddit%2Freact-multi-page-v0-13.webp))? What do these people have to gain, what drives these individuals? Perhaps, in some twisted way, I guess they get their 2 seconds of attention/dopamine they are looking for, but even then the idea of being toxic to people is so 180 that its uncomprehendable.

Insulting others, belittling, or hurting them may provide a shallow and momentary sense of power. Yet, it's a power built on tearing others down, a kind of dominance that's inherently toxic and self-destructive. It's a mindset that's so out of touch with the potential for meaningful interactions, so disconnected from the empathy and understanding that are the cornerstones of positive human relationships.

Perhaps it's a symptom of our complex modern world, where anonymity and distance make it easier for people to detach from the consequences of their actions. The virtual realm, with its perceived lack of accountability, can amplify this behavior further. Or perhaps it's a manifestation of personal insecurities, a way for these individuals to deflect their own pain onto others.

The tales these people must tell themselves to justify their actions could, in my opinion, best be described as a mental instability. It's vital to focus on building a culture of respect, compassion, and understanding, an uplifting culture that supports rather than tears down.

My manager daily undermines the self-worth of my colleagues, seemingly driven by a desire for personal satisfaction. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that his actions stem from a place of fear. It appears that he is anxious about becoming a subject of mockery and, in an attempt to avoid this, resorts to belittling others. An attempt to make people look away from him o&lt;o that way, so they don't look at him o&gt;o that way.
