<!-- ## 05/06/23 - You're not alone -->

All I want to do, is to be of service to others, even when that means my downfall. Why do I want to help others?
Why did I create this repository?
Maybe because I have empathy?
Because I know how it feels like to think you're alone in this? I feel it daily.
Maybe because I wish, that someone one day will be there for me? I try to be that someone for someone else.

You're not alone, I am out here! But am I ...?
