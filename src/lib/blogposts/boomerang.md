## 06/07/2023 Boomerang

Depression is like a boomerang, it always comes back and hits you when you least expect it.

Western societies are generally so self absorbed, that it becomes hard to differentiate between kindness and tactfulness.
Is someone actually being kind, or are they playing games? Are those around us genuinely compassionate or merely playing elaborate mind games?

Modern day capitalism prioritises self centred behaviour. Nothing you do, should be out of the kindness of your own heart, heck, are you crazy? You can make money out of that. The over reliance on money is sickening. The pursuit of financial gain overshadows other fundamental values, such as compassion and social responsibility. It's disheartening to witness the degradation of genuine acts of kindness, commodified and reduced to mere transactions. The pursuit of profit reigns supreme, overshadowing the innate desire to make a positive impact in the lives of others.

I often wonder if these self-absorbed self-centred people are just plain less intelligent. Are they blind to the richness that comes from genuine human connection? Or perhaps their intelligence lies solely in navigating the treacherous waters of self-interest, manipulating others for personal gain. It's a disheartening thought that leaves me questioning the state of our collective consciousness.

Companies always focus on profit, instead of giving their users the best value and/or the best service. In this profit-driven landscape, companies have lost sight of the true essence of their purpose. Instead of focusing on providing exceptional value and service to their users, they fixate solely on the bottom line. The concept of customer satisfaction has been reduced to a mere illusion, replaced by a relentless pursuit of profit margins. It seems that genuine care for the well-being of individuals has become an inconvenience in the quest for financial dominance.
