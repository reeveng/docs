<!-- ## 21/06/2023 Predefinition -->

One of the biggest factors on how this game will play out for you is the postcode you were born in, rather than the actual actions you undertake each and every day. Does this mean that the actions you undertake are meaningless? No and yes, to a certain degree, your actions could help you achieve more in life, yet on the flip side, these achievements might be nullified with what you could have achieved if you spawned on the other side of the planet or even the next city.

People are dumb and weird.
