<!-- ## 24/07/2023 Ideal world -->

In an ideal world, I'd work on fulfilling things. Spend a lot of time with family and friends and try to educate others on topics I am knowledgeable about. Live in an exotic country, where people are kind, thoughtful and compassionate by culture. There wouldn't be any wars. Everyone would be acknowledged for their efforts and the things they do. Pollution would halt, and people would go back to a simpler existence (somewhat) => more self reliant / community reliant.

...

Life would simply cease to exist as we know it, there would still be imperfections since those are what makes life beautiful. Things would be just different.
