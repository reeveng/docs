<!-- ## 21/08/2023 Not giving a fuck -->

Some days aren't like others. Wake up, feel like not giving a fuck.

I feel as if I've reached a new all time low, didn't know I could go any deeper.

What's wrong with me?

Why am I still alive?

Should I just end it all?

Be free from suffering for ever, no more worries, just plain nothingness.
